# MindMix

MindMix is a web-based application that transforms your audio files with binaural beat effects to help induce different mental states.

## Features

- Transform any audio file with binaural beat effects
- Choose from four frequency ranges:
  - **Delta (1-4 Hz)**: Deep sleep, relaxation, and healing
  - **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Meditation, creativity, and REM sleep
  - **Alpha (8-12 Hz)**: Relaxation, calmness, and focused states
  - **Beta (13-30 Hz)**: Alertness, concentration, and problem-solving
- Preview processed audio before downloading
- Simple, intuitive user interface with dark mode

## How It Works

MindMix works by keeping the left audio channel of your original file unchanged while applying a subtle frequency shift to the right channel. This creates a binaural beat effect that your brain perceives as the difference between the two frequencies.

## Usage

1. Upload an audio file
2. Select the desired frequency range
3. Click "Process Audio"
4. Preview your processed audio
5. Download the result
